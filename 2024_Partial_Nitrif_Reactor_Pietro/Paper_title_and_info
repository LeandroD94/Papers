Abstract:
This study investigates innovative strategies for the rapid startup of Partial Nitritation
(PN) systems for mainstream application in municipal wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs). Utilizing wasted Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) as inoculum and
implementing a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR), the investigation adopts a strategy
based on leveraging the pre-existing granular structure and applying precise Dissolved
Oxygen (DO) control to selectively enrich ammonium-oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) without
relying on chemical inhibition by Free Ammonia (FA) or Free Nitrous Acid (FNA) as
conducted in many studies. This operational approach enabled the effective
conversion of mature biomass into Partial Nitritation Granular Sludge (PN-GS) by
initially cultivating heterogeneous AGS and subsequently replacing the feeding to
promote the transition to an autotrophic PN system. The goal was enriching the sludge
with AOB, maintaining the granule characteristics and achieving an appropriate
biomass concentration. During the transition, a significant biomass decay was
observed (from 7.9 to 1.8 gVSS·L-1), but granular structure was preserved, ensuring
excellent settling properties (SVI30=54±3 mL·g-1TSS). Under mainstream conditions,
with an influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg N·L-1 and an average temperature
of 19.6°C, the system achieved a specific Ammonium Oxidation Rate (sAOR) of
107±11.8 mgNH4-N·g-1VSS·d-1 and a Nitrite Accumulation Efficiency (NAE) of
90±4%. Microbiota analysis revealed significant enrichment of Nitrosomonas (>20%
relative abundance vs ≈1% in the inoculum) and the suppression of Nitrospira (≈1%).
These findings establish a solid foundation for integrating mainstream PN-GS systems
into sustainable wastewater treatment practices, supporting the overall transition
toward energy-neutral WWTPs.
