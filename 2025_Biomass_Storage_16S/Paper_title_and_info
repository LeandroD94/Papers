Abstract:
Immediate DNA extraction from microbial communities upon sample collection is not always feasible. 
Consequently, numerous studies have investigated the effects of storage on biomass composition, yet no clear consensus has been reached.
Furthermore, these studies have primarily focused on human-associated tissues or soils. 
In this paper, we tested the storage-induced biases in the case of flocs from activated sludge tank and granules from aerobic granular sludge reactors prior to 16S rRNA sequencing. 
Different storage temperatures (4 °C, −20 °C, −80 °C) and durations (up to 3 years), as well as the use of glycerol as cryo-protectant, were evaluated. 
Briefly, thawing primarily affected the most abundant community members, as expected, but detectable losses were also observed in less abundant yet relevant taxa. 
Nevertheless, in most cases overall community profiles remained consistent enough to prevent sample misidentification, even under the least favourable storage conditions. 
Moreover, glycerol addition did not always resulted beneficial.
