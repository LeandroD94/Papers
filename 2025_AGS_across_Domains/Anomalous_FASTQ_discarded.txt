Each of the files SRR17089440 and SRR17089441 has only reverse and forward reads respectively (40_2, 41_1), then are not paired... also downloading again does not solve this problem, then they are discarded from the analysis

Moreover, also the FASTQ SRR17089439 has been discarded because its forward reads was much more than the reverse (?)
